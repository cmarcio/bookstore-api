# Library API

This as a RESTful API for a simple library. The goal of this project is to explore the architecture of a Express API and practice some coding.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need to install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on your machine.

### Folder structure

### Installing

In order to run the project do the following:

Install the project dependencies

```
$ cd <project-folder>

## Notes

* When the server starts it will also starts a service to get some book data from this [website](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/books.html). The data might take some time to be available in the database, and after that will be update every hour.

* Some configuration is expected to come from environment variables, but have a default value in case they are not provided. I added this to simplify the setup, but in a real cenario it would be very importante to set the environment variables correctely.
